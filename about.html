                <p>Thank you for visiting my page, let me tell you more about myself .<br>
                    <br>
                    I am a former English teacher with a passion for languages and learning, I can speak basic German
                    and French, but my native language is Polish. During one of my work trips I fell in love with
                    Manchester and decided I need to move in to this beautiful city and here I am.
                    <br>
                    I learned HTML,CSS and JavaScript on my own, later I completed Code Nation 3 week coding boot camp
                    where I learned the basics of Python and from then on I knew my heart is set for a back-end work. I
                    am currently learning Python and developing new projects that I can share with the world. There are
                    many more technologies that I would love to learn, especially in a professional setting when I can
                    get to work with other people in the field. I feel very good in group oriented projects as well as I
                    feel confident working on my own.
                    <br>
                    I am currently working in hospitality. This work environment was completely different from my
                    teaching role but my organisation, peoples skills and being flexible is what helped me in both of
                    those roles. I do love the fast pace of the work and contact with people but I needed some more
                    challenges and mental stimulation.
                    <br>
                    As I need personal growth and software development runs in my family,I decided to give it a go. The
                    more I was exploring and learning the more I realised how perfect fit I am for this world. Loving
                    literature and being a creative person, I didn't realise that software engineering is something that
                    can align with my passions and mindset but I found out that creativity and inquisitiveness is a core
                    of successful learning. I decided that this will soon become my job and I am consequently working on
                    achieving this goal.
                    <br>
